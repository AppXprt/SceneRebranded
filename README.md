APPEARANCE

The visual appearance of an Scene-powered site is defined by a selected theme (themes are extensions that set siteâ€™s fonts, color scheme, and layout). Scene default package includes several standard themes, with more themes available for download. Users can also create their own custom themes. Themes can be customized via the Admin Panel, using simple customization interface. Additional theme customization can be done with an FTP client.
